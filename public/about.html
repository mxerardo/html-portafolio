<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Gerardo, and I'm originally from Guanajuato, Mexico. I'm 35 years old,<br/>
  and I'm currently in the process of learning how to program. Technology has always<br/>
  intrigued me, but it was only a few months ago that I decided to take the plunge.<br/> 
  I have a background in industrial engineering and possess 11 years of professional<br/> 
  experience in various industries, including automotive, motorcycling, and even the<br/>
  healthcare sector..</p>

<p>I enjoy playing the piano, drawing, and attending concerts. However, my greatest pastime<br/>
  is reading. So far, my favorite books include "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel,<br/>
  "Sapiens" by Yuval Harari, and "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" by author Rebecca Skloot.</p>
